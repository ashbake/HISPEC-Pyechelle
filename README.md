### Overview

File dump of code used to make HISPEC HDF files

The final HDF files can be found on the HISPEC Sharepoint, e.g.:
HISPEC_HK_20231006B-1_trace1.hdf
HISPEC_yJ_20231006A-1_trace1.hdf

Note the HDF file generator scripts relied on edits to the Pyechelle source code that allowed the latest version of zospy to be used as of Dec 2025. 
Python 3.12 was used and the new Ansys Zemax version (2025 R2.01). The code is set up for interactive mode.
